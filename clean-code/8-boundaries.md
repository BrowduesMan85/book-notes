## LEARNING TESTS ARE BETTER THAN FREE
- We had to learn the 3rd party API anyway
- "Learning" tests help us in the future if the 3rd party API changes. In that case, we can ensure our understood behavior remains
  

## USING CODE THAT DOES NOT YET EXIST
- Define a fake interface you "wished you had"
- This allows the real interface to be implemented later and depend on your ideal interface
