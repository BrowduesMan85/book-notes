## COMMENTS DO NOT MAKE UP FOR BAD CODE
- comments are a necessary evil at best
- comments compensate for our failure to express ourself in code
- Clear code >>> expresssing yourself with comments
  
## GOOD COMMENTS
- Legal Comments
- Informative Comments
- Explanation of Intent
- Clarification
- Warning of Consequences
- Amplification - something that would have otherwise seemed inconsequential

## BAD COMMENTS (Most fall into this category)
- Mumbling
- Redundant Comments
  - The code speaks for itself
- Misleading Comments
  - e.g: "if" vs. "when"
- Mandated Comments
  - For example, a docstring
- Donâ€™t Use a Comment When You Can Use a Function or a Variable
- Position Markers
- Closing Brace Comments
    ```
    func foo (){

    } // foo
    ```
- Attributions and Bylines
  - e.g: `// Added by Nicholas`
- Commented-Out Code
- HTML Comments
- Nonlocal information, such as system-level info
- Too Much Information
  - Historical details
  - etc...
- Inobvious Connection
