## THE PURPOSE OF FORMATTING
- ... is communication

## VERTICAL FORMATTING
- small files are generally preferable to larger files

### The Newspaper Metaphor
- spource files should be like articles in a newspaper
  - very few articles take a whole page
  - good articles follow a common format

### Vertical Density
- Lines that are coupled should be close together

### Vertical Distance
- Variable Declarations
  - as close to their usage as possible
- Instance variables
  - declared at the top
- Dependent Functions
  - if one function calls another, they should be as vertically close as possible

### Vertical Ordering
- Prefer function call before declaration (opposite languages like c++)

## HORIZONTAL FORMATTING
- 80-120 chars
